# Project planning BEFORE iteration-1

## Main Goal for the Project

To develop a comprehensive digital gym management platform for JCU students that transforms the current manual and fragmented system into a fully online, user-friendly, and engaging experience. The system will:

* Streamline gym membership registration through automated student ID integration

* Improve transparency and convenience in booking by showing real-time availability and crowd levels

* Promote safe and effective workouts through guided instructions and personalized fitness plans

* Support maintenance and staff coordination via equipment status monitoring

* Boost student engagement through a reward system and an interactive fitness community

Ultimately, the platform aims to increase gym participation, reduce administrative burden, and enhance the health and safety of all users.
