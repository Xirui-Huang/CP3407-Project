## Iteration 1 [week 3 - week 6], start date: 2025/6/4 → 2025/7/7

### Main Goal for Iteration-1

#### Deliver a functional core gym access system that enables:

* Students to join online via their student ID through a digitized membership process

* Real-time visibility of available gym booking slots and current occupancy

* Guided instruction on proper exercise technique through demonstration videos

## subject plan

### week 3 – Website preview layout

This week focused on developing a preview interface for the gym website. The goal was to give customers an idea of the platform before using it. Initially, the team had different opinions about the layout design, which delayed progress. After a dedicated design discussion, a final version was agreed upon and implemented.

### week 4 – Membership process digitization

We shifted focus to replacing the traditional paper-based membership registration with an online process. The form design and student ID verification logic were completed smoothly. Minor issues occurred when testing with sample student IDs, which were resolved by adjusting the validation rules.

### week 5 – Booking availability check

We developed the booking visibility feature, allowing users to check available time slots and current occupancy. The challenge was integrating real-time updates from the database. After debugging connection delays, the team managed to implement live slot status updates successfully.

### week 6 – Demonstration videos
The team added a video library showing correct exercise techniques to prevent injuries. The main challenge was optimizing video loading speed while maintaining quality. We resolved this by using compressed video formats and lazy loading.

## Iteration 2 [week 7 - week 10], start date: 2025/7/14 → 2025/8/10

### Main Goal for Iteration-2

#### Deliver an enhanced gym management system that enables:

* Students to complete bookings quickly through an auto-filled booking process

* Technicians to monitor real-time equipment status for timely maintenance

* Students to receive personalized fitness plan recommendations

* Users to engage with a community to share experiences and receive feedback

* Sponsors to display advertisements within the gym system for greater reach

* Departments to implement a reward system that encourages student participation in exercise

## subject plan

### week 7 – Simplification of booking process
The booking form was improved to automatically fill user details, reducing repetitive input. Initially, the system sometimes loaded outdated data, which was fixed by updating the cache-clearing logic.

### week 8 – Equipment monitoring and fitness plan recommendation

We integrated an equipment status tracking feature for technicians and a fitness plan recommendation module for students. The monitoring system required calibration of equipment status reports, while the recommendation module involved fine-tuning based on student profiles. Both were successfully deployed.

### week 9 – Community and advertising functions

A community forum was introduced for users to share experiences and receive feedback. Additionally, an advertising display section was created for sponsors. The main difficulty was ensuring ads did not interfere with the community interface, which was solved by using a separate dedicated ad space.

### week 10 – Reward system implementation

The reward system was launched to encourage students to participate in exercise. Technical challenges arose when linking the reward data with attendance records. After multiple testing rounds, the reward points were successfully synced with user profiles.
